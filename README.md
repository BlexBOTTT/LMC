# Little Man Computer Simulation - User Interface Change

This project is a simulation of the Little Man Computer (LMC), utilizing the core files function from [FrBrGeorge/peterhigginson](https://github.com/FrBrGeorge/peterhigginson).

## Credits

## Changes Made

The primary focus of this project was to modify the user interface (UI) of the Little Man Computer simulation. All changes are limited to the UI, and the core functionality remains the same as provided by [FrBrGeorge/peterhigginson](https://github.com/FrBrGeorge/peterhigginson).
